   - Status: Not running due to database connectivity issues
   - Issue: Cannot connect to PostgreSQL database at localhost:5432

2. **Database Services**: PostgreSQL & Redis
   - Required by the API service
   - Status: Not running due to Docker permission issues
   - Issue: Docker requires elevated privileges on Windows

## Next Steps

1. To fully run the platform, you'll need to:
   - Start Docker with elevated privileges
   - Run `docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.db.yml up -d` to start PostgreSQL and Redis
   - Restart the API service with proper database connectivity

2. Alternatively, you can set up PostgreSQL and Redis manually:
   - Install PostgreSQL (port 5432) with database "kids" and user "kids"/password "kids"
   - Install Redis (port 6379)
   - Then restart the API service

## Summary

The frontend applications are running successfully and can be accessed via the URLs above. The backend services are not fully operational due to database connectivity issues, but the frontend UI should be visible and partially functional.
