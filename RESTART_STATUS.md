## Issues Resolved

### @kids/forms Package Resolution
The issue with the @kids/forms package has been resolved:
- Fixed the package.json configuration to correctly point to the generated files
- Changed "main" from "dist/index.js" to "dist/index.umd.js"
- Changed "module" from "dist/index.js" to "dist/index.mjs"
- Updated the "exports" section to correctly reference the actual generated files

### Student App Routing and Store Issues
Fixed issues in the student app:
- Corrected the StudentProvider implementation to properly use the reducer
- Fixed routing implementation to use React Router correctly
- Updated AppLayout to properly use Outlet for nested routes

The forms package was generating index.mjs and index.umd.js files, but the package.json was incorrectly pointing to dist/index.js which didn't exist.
