# M6 Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented M6 features to make the homepage and courses "really come alive" with dynamic progress tracking, streak days calculation, and placeholder pages for leaderboard and works.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Progress Tracking with Streak Days
- Enhanced `progressStore` to track `lastActivityDate` and calculate `streakDays`
- Added streak calculation logic that:
  - Increases streak for consecutive days of activity
  - Resets streak after a day of inactivity
  - Maintains streak on same-day activities

### 2. Student Stats Refresh
- Updated `studentStore` to include `refreshStats()` action
- Modified all game runners (IO, LED, Maze) to call `refreshStats()` after level completion
- Updated HomePage and CoursesPage to refresh stats on component mount

### 3. Enhanced Homepage
- Added real-time display of streak days and XP
- Progress cards now show actual completion statistics
- Stats update immediately after completing levels

### 4. Enhanced Courses Page
- Progress bars now reflect actual completion status
- Real-time updates when navigating between pages

### 5. Leaderboard Page (Placeholder)
- Created functional leaderboard with fake data
- Shows XP-based ranking with visual indicators for top positions
- Includes ranking rules explanation

### 6. Works Page (Placeholder)
- Created functional works portfolio with fake data
- Shows sample projects with tags, likes, and creation dates
- Includes submission prompt and tips

## Acceptance Criteria Met
✅ Stats update in real-time after level completion
✅ Homepage shows accurate streak days and XP
✅ Courses page shows actual progress percentages
✅ Leaderboard page displays with fake data
✅ Works page displays with fake data
✅ All pages are navigable and functional

## Additional Fixes
- Fixed TypeScript errors in judge-stub package
- Fixed linting errors in teacher app related to missing dayjs import
- Enhanced all game runners to properly refresh student stats after level completion

## Known Issues
- Some TypeScript errors exist in the student app that need to be addressed
- Executor service has configuration issues that prevent it from running
- Some linting warnings remain but don't affect functionality

## Next Steps
1. Fix remaining TypeScript errors in student app
2. Resolve executor service configuration issues
3. Implement real data for leaderboard and works pages
4. Add more comprehensive error handling
5. Implement additional features as required by future milestones

The core M6 functionality has been successfully implemented and is working as expected.
