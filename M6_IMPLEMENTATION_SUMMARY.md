# M6 Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented M6 features to make the homepage and courses "really come alive" with dynamic progress tracking, streak days calculation, and placeholder pages for leaderboard and works.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Progress Tracking with Streak Days
- Enhanced `progressStore` to track `lastActivityDate` and calculate `streakDays`
- Added streak calculation logic that:
  - Increases streak for consecutive days of activity
  - Resets streak after a day of inactivity
  - Maintains streak on same-day activities

### 2. Student Stats Refresh
- Updated `studentStore` to include `refreshStats()` action
- Modified all game runners (IO, LED, Maze) to call `refreshStats()` after level completion
- Updated HomePage and CoursesPage to refresh stats on component mount

### 3. Enhanced Homepage
- Added real-time display of streak days and XP
- Progress cards now show actual completion statistics
- Stats update immediately after completing levels

### 4. Enhanced Courses Page
- Progress bars now reflect actual completion status
- Real-time updates when navigating between pages

### 5. Leaderboard Page (Placeholder)
- Created functional leaderboard with fake data
- Shows XP-based ranking with visual indicators for top positions
- Includes ranking rules explanation

### 6. Works Page (Placeholder)
- Created functional works portfolio with fake data
- Shows sample projects with tags, likes, and creation dates
- Includes submission prompt and tips
