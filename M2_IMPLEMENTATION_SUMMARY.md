# M2 Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the M2 features for the kids coding platform, which focuses on creating a playable IO game loop with level progression and reward systems.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Level Manifest Generation
- **Script**: `scripts/build-level-manifest.mts`
- **Function**: Scans `docs/levels/**` directory structure and generates `apps/student-app/public/levels/manifest.json`
- **Output**: Contains game packs and level metadata for frontend consumption

### 2. Level Repository Service
- **File**: `apps/student-app/src/services/level.repo.ts`
- **Function**: Fetches and manages level data from the generated manifest
- **Methods**:
  - `getPacks(lang)`: Get all game packs for a language
  - `getLevels(lang, gameType)`: Get all levels for a specific game type
  - `getLevelById(id)`: Get a specific level by ID

### 3. Play Page Implementation
- **File**: `apps/student-app/src/pages/PlayPage.tsx`
- **Function**: Displays level information and integrates game runners
- **Features**:
  - Dynamic level loading based on URL parameter
  - Display of level goals, story, and hints
  - Integration with game-specific runners

### 4. IO Runner Component
- **File**: `apps/student-app/src/games/io/IORunner.tsx`
- **Function**: Provides a playable interface for IO-type levels
- **Features**:
  - Code editor (textarea)
  - Input data field
  - Run button with execution simulation
  - Result display with pass/fail status
  - Reward popup on successful completion

### 5. Progress Tracking
- **File**: `apps/student-app/src/store/progress.ts`
- **Function**: Manages student progress using localStorage
- **Features**:
  - Track completed levels
  - Accumulate XP and coins
  - Persist progress between sessions

### 6. Recommendation Service
- **File**: `apps/student-app/src/services/recommend.ts`
- **Function**: Determines next recommended level based on progress and unlock requirements
- **Features**:
  - Calculates next level based on prerequisites
  - Recommends appropriate game pack

### 7. Judge Stub
- **Package**: `packages/judge-stub`
- **Function**: Provides local simulation of code judging for testing
- **Features**:
  - IO-type level judging simulation
  - Test cases validation

## Key Components

### Data Flow
1. Level data is stored in `docs/levels/**` as JSON files
2. Build script generates `manifest.json` for frontend consumption
3. Level repository loads manifest and provides data access
4. Play page fetches level data and renders appropriate runner
5. IO Runner simulates code execution and judging
6. Progress store tracks completion and rewards

```

## Testing
- IO Runner tested with py-io-001 and py-io-002 levels
- Judge stub includes test cases for validation
- Progress tracking verified through localStorage

## Next Steps
1. Implement additional game runners (LED, Maze, etc.)
2. Connect to real Python execution backend
3. Enhance UI/UX with better styling and animations
4. Add more comprehensive testing
5. Implement additional reward systems

## Verification
To verify the implementation:
1. Run `pnpm levels:build` to generate the manifest
2. Start the student app with `pnpm dev`
3. Navigate to http://localhost:5174/play/py-io-001
4. Enter correct code: `print('Hello, Island!')`
5. Click "Run Code" and observe successful completion
6. Check localStorage for progress tracking
