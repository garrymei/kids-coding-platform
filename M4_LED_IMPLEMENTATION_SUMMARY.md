# M4 LED Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the LED bulb game with event flow and replay functionality as specified in the M4 requirements.

## âœ… Completed Features

### T4-1: LED Runner with Event Replay
- **Location**: `apps/student-app/src/games/led/LEDRunner.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Event parsing from code (on{i}, off{i} commands)
  - LED visualization with configurable grid (5/8 light strips)
  - Event replay functionality with play/pause/reset controls
  - Real-time LED state visualization during replay
  - Support for both event sequence and final state judging

### T4-2: LED Judge (Server-side)
- **Location**: `server/api/src/modules/judge/led.controller.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Dedicated LED judge controller with `/judge/led` endpoint
  - Event sequence exact matching
  - Final state matching (e.g., "10101010")
  - Support for both local and remote judging
  - Comprehensive error handling and detailed feedback

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Frontend (LED Runner)
1. **Event Parsing**: Parses `on{i}` and `off{i}` commands from user code
2. **LED Grid**: Visualizes LED states with configurable width/height
3. **Event Replay**: Animated playback of LED events with timing
4. **Judge Integration**: Toggle between local and remote judging
5. **Progress Tracking**: Integration with progress store for XP/coins

### Backend (LED Judge)
1. **LED Strategy**: `server/api/src/modules/judge/strategies/led.strategy.ts`
2. **Judge Controller**: `server/api/src/modules/judge/led.controller.ts`
3. **Event Matching**: Exact sequence comparison for event-based levels
4. **State Matching**: Final LED state comparison for IO-based levels
5. **Module Integration**: Updated judge module to include LED controller

## ðŸŽ® Supported Level Types

### Event Sequence Levels (e.g., py-led-001, py-led-011)
- **Mode**: `event`
- **Judging**: Exact sequence matching
- **Example**: `["on0", "on1", "on2", "on3", "on4"]`

### Final State Levels (e.g., py-led-021)
- **Mode**: `io`
- **Judging**: Final LED state matching
- **Example**: `"10101010"` (alternating pattern)

## ðŸš€ Usage

### Frontend
```tsx
// LED Runner automatically handles:
// - Code parsing
// - Event extraction
// - LED visualization
// - Judge integration
<LEDRunner level={level} />
```

### Backend API
```bash
# Event sequence judging
POST /judge/led
{
  "code": "print('on0')\nprint('on1')",
  "grader": {
    "mode": "event",
    "checks": [{"type": "eventSeq", "expect": ["on0", "on1"]}]
  },
  "assets": {"gridWidth": 5, "gridHeight": 1}
}

# Final state judging
POST /judge/led
{
  "code": "print('on0')\nprint('on2')",
  "grader": {
    "mode": "io",
    "io": {"cases": [{"in": "", "out": "10101010"}]}
  },
  "assets": {"gridWidth": 8, "gridHeight": 1}
}
```

## âœ… Acceptance Criteria Met

1. **py-led-001/011/021**: All levels can be played with proper event visualization
2. **Event Replay**: 5/8 light strip visualization with event playback
3. **Judge Integration**: Both local and remote judging work correctly
4. **Server-side Matching**: Event sequence and final state matching implemented
5. **UI Integration**: Seamless integration with existing game framework

## ðŸ”„ Next Steps

The LED game implementation is complete and ready for integration with the broader platform. The system supports:
- Multiple LED grid configurations
- Both event-based and state-based judging
- Local and remote judge switching
- Comprehensive error handling
- Progress tracking and rewards

All M4 requirements have been successfully implemented and tested.
